--- Requirements ---
--------------------

- CUDA Toolkit
Paimon expects the CUDA Toolkit to be installed in /usr/local/cuda
If your installation is found elsewhere then change CUDALIB inside
the Makefile to reflect the installation directory.

- CUDA SDK
The CUDA kernels used by Paimon rely on some of the headers from the
examples packaged with the CUDA SDK. By default, Paimon expects these
examples to be found in /usr/local/cuda/samples/common/inc. If your 
installation differs, update INC_CUDA in the Makefile to reflect this.

-----------------------------
--- Compiling with Paimon ---
-----------------------------

Compiling with Paimon is a two-step process. First, once the above is in
place, cd to paimon/ and compile Paimon with 'make'. This will compile
Paimon to a static library in lib/libPaimon.a

Second, you will need to include the headers and link to Paimon. If using
a Makefile and the Paimon directory is at the top of your project, 
I suggest defining the following somewhere in your project's Makefile:

LIB_CUDA = -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lcudart
INC_PAIMON = -I<project path>/paimon/include
LIB_PAIMON = -L<project path>/paimon/lib -lPaimon

Then the compilation for your project might look something like this:

g++ <cflags> <includes> $(INC_PAIMON) main.cpp <libs> $(LIB_PAIMON) $(LIB_CUDA) <more libs -o ./run

Order is important. Make sure the headers come before the source files.
LIB_PAIMON MUST COME BEFORE LIB_CUDA. Otherwise you will get nasty linker
errors. 

You should only need to include CFDSolver.h to use the fluid solver. Paimon 
is set up so that you do not need to compile with nvcc if you just include 
CFDSolver.h in your project. If you start including headers that rely on 
cuda.h, then you should either reconsider what you're trying to do, or 
you will need to use nvcc for compilation. That has its own set of problems.

-------------------------------
--- Warning from the author ---
-------------------------------

While I tried to ensure Paimon worked cleanly, adding CUDA to a project
can add some amount of frustration. I tried to safeguard CFDSolver so that
it should play nice. However, there may still be some odd bugs here or there.
Feel free to contact the author with questions or if you find a bug.

Altering the kernels/graphics without at least a modicum of knowledge of 
GPGPU/graphics programming can lead to some pretty bizarre and frustrating 
results.

You are free to change Paimon as you wish, but please attribute the author
as required by GPLv3 or later. 

Good luck and godspeed~
